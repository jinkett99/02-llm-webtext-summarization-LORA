News Bunkerspot catches up with Dr Prapisala Thepsithar for a progress report on GCMDs ongoing series of biofuel trials Published on 9 April 2024 Link copied to clipboard First featured in Bunkerspot, Volume 21, Number 2, April May 2024 The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation GCMD was launched in Singapore in August 2021 with the intention of supporting shippings energy transition by, amongst other initiatives, running a series of trials and pilot to lower the barriers for broad market adoption of low zero carbon solutions. The approach of the non profit organisation is to prioritise real world testing, translating 2D recommendations to 3D solutions. By simulating commercial conditions, GCMDs learnings can be translated directly into knowledge based on robust analyses of generated data or collated information. These learnings are then validated by project partners, and shared openly with the ecosystem. At its inception, GCMD had six industry partners BHP, BW Group, Eastern Pacific Shipping, Foundation Det Norske Veritas, Ocean Network Express and Seatrium formerly Sembcorp Marine . GCMD also receives funding from the Maritime Port Authority MPA for qualifying research and development programmes and projects. Since then, over 100 centre and project level partners have joined contributing funds, expertise and in kind support to accelerate the deployment of scalable low carbon technologies and lowering adoption barriers. A key strand of work at the Centre is its drop in biofuels assurance project which was first announced in July 2022. In February 2023, GCMD announced the completion of two supply chain trials of biofuel blends sourced from different origins. The trials took place between October 2022 and February 2023 and focused on two biofuel blends Used Cooking Oil Methyl Ester UCOME , a type of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester FAME , blended with very low sulphur fuel oil VLSFO and UCOME blended with high sulphur fuel oil HSFO . On these first two supply chain trials, GCMD worked with Chevron and TotalEnergies Marine Fuels TEMF these fuel suppliers have existing contracts with, and were nominated by, the shipowners and charterers that are involved in the trials. After the trials had concluded,Bunkerspotspoke with Dr Prapisala Thepsithar, Projects Director at GCMD and Laura Ong, TEMFs Head of Bunker Sales and Operations to discuss some of the outcomes of the TEMF pilot Bunkerspot April May 2023 . At the time, Dr Thepsithar emphasised that much work remained to be done to develop an assurance framework to be put in place as the availability of green bunker fuels scales up. Thats why in the current project we are focusing on biofuels FAME, HVO, UCOME because they are available and generally compatible with existing bunkering infrastructure, storage systems and marine engines, she said. A key challenge around the use of biofuels is establishing the provenance of the feedstock used in their production, and the first two trials used synthetic DNA tracer technologies to establish the origin of the products and tracked their journey along the fuel supply chain. Commenting after these pilots, Dr Thepsithar said that Initial field trials surfaced some challenges with replicating and reproducing results. However, these hurdles are not insurmountable. By understanding the limitations of tracers, we can incorporate their application into a framework that delivers consistent and robust performance, achieving the intended outcomes. The project has progressed since then, with a third trial taking place last July at the Port of Vlissingen in the Netherlands. This trial involved GoodFuels supplying around 200 metric tonnes of pilot fuel that formed the basis of a B30 biofuel blend of hydrotreated vegetable oil HVO and marine gasoil MGO . The trial took place on theKaupaung, an LPG dual fuelled gas carrier operated by Eastern Pacific Shipping EPS . On this occasion, GCMD worked with Control Union and IDS to use an element based tracer in the HVO to assure its origination and quantity in the biofuel blend. This trial was also noteworthy because the tracer was dosed in line with HVO and blended with MGO onboard the bunker vessel. Catching up with Dr Thepsithar in early April for a progress update on the biofuel trials, she emphasised the difference between the two earlier Singapore trials and the one carried out in Vlissingen. First of all the feedstock is renewable and the contents of HVO are very similar to that of MGO, she said. If you do standard laboratory analysis you wont be able to differentiate them. You can only use certain methods, like carbon dating ,i.e., which measures the ratio between carbon isotopes carbon 12 and carbon 14. This analysis is able to differentiate between biogenic carbon, and fossil carbon. The use of an element based tracer in a biofuel blend containing similar molecules in their constituents, i.e., HVO and MGO, is key, as it acts as a quantifier and thus enables the verification of the contracted biofuel blend ratio in the bunker fuel, i.e., B30 having 30 biofuels. In the Dutch trial, the biofuel blend was used as a pilot fuel. As Dr Thepsithar explained, HVO is generally known for being more stable than FAME and it is also almost chemically identical to diesel so there should be no concerns over its stability as a pilot fuel. A common concern of the technical feasibility of biofuels as alternative green marine fuel is the limited scope of current trials. This lack of extensive testing raises questions on the performance of biofuels after extended periods of storage on board vessels. In terms of the ongoing GCMD biofuel trials, Dr Thepsithar said the focus is on tracking the integrity of the biofuel and biofuel blend across the supply chain over a period of five months. While trials using FAME supplied from the Port of Singapore have not shown any significant degradation against fuel quality standards ISO 8217 , the long term impact of biofuels on overall vessel performance remains undocumented and unavailable to the public. This lack of data warrants a thorough investigations to build confidence in biofuels as a green marine fuel solution to achieve maritimes decarbonisation targets. Returning again to the issue of feedstock provenance, Dr Thepsithar said that in addition to deploying a DNA tracer, as in the case of the first two trials, the GCMD initiative is also looking at the fingerprint of the biofuel itself. For FAME, the fingerprint is a crucial indicator of its origins i.e., traceability to their feedstocks and its properties. GCMD is currently working on its fourth trial, originating from Rotterdam, which involves the supply of FAME blended with VLSFO and the use of another type of tracer. This trial is slated for the first half of the year. Digitalisation is currently another of shippings buzzword, with the analysis of significant amounts of data leading to optimisation of vessel operations, routing, fuel consumption, etc. Dr Thepsithar said that the data and information from the Centres supply chain trials, will form the basis by which the upcoming quality, quantity and GHG abatement assurance framework will be articulated. She believes this framework can serve as a strong foundation for developing a digital enabled platforms that can help deploy the assurance framework for drop in green fuels broadly. The International Maritime Organization is now moving to assess marine fuels based on their respective well to wake GHG emissions profile, as opposed to current tank to wake limits. Some EU environmental legislation is also taking this approach. However, to quantify the well to wake emissions of marine fuel is not without its challenges. In terms of accounting for upstream emissions of biofuels originating from its feedstock and production, Dr Thepsithar said that this is well accounted by the ISCC certification methodology. However, when considering the emissions associated with transporting biofuels from the country of origin to the country of use, GCMD is, again, keen to take a real world approach to ensure that GHG emissions on this section of the supply chain are accurate. She further explained that GHG emissions figures can be impacted by factors, such as the size of and distance travelled by liquid bulk carriers transporting the fuel. Whilst standard conversion factors offer a simpler way to calculate GHG emissions, they may not accurately reflect the GHG footprint of parcel sizes and distance travelled. Recognising the potential financial impact of inaccurate GHG footprint calculations, such as carbon taxes and price premiums, GCMD is actively developing more accurate methodologies for evaluating the GHG emissions of biofuels. Looking ahead, Dr Thepsithar said that GCMD plans to execute a supply chain out of the US to lend robustness of the assurance framework. It will also explore the use of crude algae oil because we think it has the potential to scale the availability and use of biofuels. GCMD is now preparing a series of white papers on the outcomes of the biofuel trials, encompassing issues, such as traceability, biofuel quality, supply chain optimisation and abatement costs, and these will be published across the year in 2024. For Dr Thepsithar, a question emerging from all the biofuel trials that GCMD has conducted is, How does all the information collated inform the bigger picture on the assurance for drop in green fuels . We endeavour to do something different for each trial, she said. So, by blending in all these different tracers into the fuel ranging from smaller to larger batches, we aim to evaluate if success extends to larger batches. Our approach is on scalability in the real world, moving from 200 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes of fuel.

In 2022, Singapore recorded 45 workplace fatalities1, with 10 of them attributed to warehouse accidents2. Warehouse accidents can occur due to various reasons, such as inadequate training, lack of appropriate safety equipment, and machinery maintenance which can result in injuries, property damage, and even loss of life. Governments in the region have introduced and enforced mandatory safety regulations, such as Singapores Workplace Safety and Health Act, Japans Industrial Safety and Health Act, and Australias Work Health and Safety Act.Although laws and regulations are crucial for improving workplace safety, they are not a panacea.Workplace safety a different perspectiveBy implementing technology and warehouse automation, we can reduce the risks of accidents resulting from slip and fall hazards, collisions with machinery or other objects, human errors, heavy lifting, exposure to hazardous materials, and other physical strains that can lead to injuries. This paves the way for workplace and warehouse operators to simultaneously benefit from workplace safety for both economic and welfare reasons.Workplace safety measures help prevent accidents and injuries, reducing compensation claims. Secondly, prioritising workplace safety and well being can increase job satisfaction among employees, who are also the heartware of the company. When employees feel valued and cared for, they are more likely to be more productive, efficient and accurate, leading to increased accuracy and reduced lost workdays and medical compensations. They are inextricably linked as investing in workplace safety measures is not only responsible, but also fosters a culture of care and respect for employees, ultimately leading to increased employee satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, all of which can contribute to the overall success and profitability of a business.Your new colleagueAutonomous forklifts are a game changer in the world of workplace safety. They are designed to minimise the need for physical exertion involving heavy lifting and reduce the chances of human errors, so that workers can work more efficiently and focus on high level jobs that provide better compensation. Autonomous forklifts can operate safely alongside human operators, detecting potential hazards such as a person approaching them, alerting the worker through its warning lights and avoiding collision by activating its obstacle avoidance function. With technology and warehouse automation becoming an essential part of ensuring workplace safety, technology can be viewed as a new colleague to warehouse operators empowering them to work safely and more efficiently.Workplace safety is a duo approachWorkplace safety is a collaborative effort between humans and robots, where technology supports workers in performing tasks safely and efficiently. Repetitive and physically demanding tasks that can potentially harm workers should be handled by automation while the human operators monitor its performance and intervene when necessary. Human workers can also be responsible for identifying potential hazards that may not be detectable by technology and taking appropriate measures to mitigate those risks. By combining the strengths of both human and robotic intervention, workplace safety can be optimised and accidents can be reduced.At the same time, it is important to note that implementing warehouse automation is not as simple as purchasing off the shelf solutions with the aim to heighten workplace safety standards overnight. Instead, it should be a deliberated and detailed process where your operational and business needs are carefully assessed and communicated to the automation provider. An overhaul of the entire system may not always be necessary or feasible, and the provider should comprehend the unique requirements of a business and tailor solutions to suit those needs.Nurturing the heartware to develop a liking for hardwareThe truth about warehouse automation is that technology adoption without adequate training and partnership with the right intelligent warehouse solution provider will prevent operators from meeting their business goals. Such an outcome is also at the expense of workplace safety.As such, leaders have a vital role to play in leading the journey of workplace safety. Its important for leaders to communicate a balanced viewpoint and gain buy in from their workers and emphasise the benefits of warehouse automation while also acknowledging the importance of human intervention. It is essential to convey how humans have a cognitive power that robots cannot replace, and together, they form an effective combination for warehouse automation. Retraining workers is also crucial to get them in tune with the extra pair of helping steel hands they have on deck now. Lastly, leaders should continually show appreciation to their workers when they eventually reap the benefits of heightened productivity and increased customer satisfaction.Automation solutions must be implemented thoughtfully, with a focus on addressing the specific needs of each operation and the potential risks associated with their work processes. XSQUARE Technologies is committed to working with warehouse operators to develop automation solutions that meet their needs, prioritise workplace safety and help businesses achieve their operational goals. 1 https www.todayonline.com singapore singaporean worker 31 dies pinned machine workplace accident death 45 2080651 2 https www.straitstimes.com singapore 36 lives lost workplace fatalities in spore in 2022As published in WSH Asia.

The great belt link has united Denmark and moved boundaries within bridge engineering. If you were to build the longest suspension bridge in the world, what would be the biggest hurdles from an engineering perspective Looking closer at the East Bridge which forms part of the Great Belt Link in Denmark, one element looms larger than the rest The strong winds swirling in from the Atlantic Ocean. GREAT BELT LINK TWO BRIDGES, ONE TUNNEL Sprog, in the middle of Storeblt Great Belt , connects the two bridges and the tunnel. As part of the construction work, the island was expanded and is now four times its original size. A FIXED LINK TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIME Before we look closer at the challenging wind conditions, let's zoom in on the bigger purpose behind the Great Belt Link. In the past millennium, people with family, friends, work or other interests at the other side of the Great Belt had to take a ferry or cross it by foot during the icy winters. Ideas for a fixed link were first discussed in the 1850s, with a view to reducing travel times. Finally, in 1986 a political agreement was reached and a new law was passed that gave the green light for the project to start. Time savings and ticket price savings for customers were the main drivers for the bridge, explains Lars Fuhr, CTO and Technical Director at Sund Blt Holding A S. Before the bridge, when we had the ferries, crossing the Storebaelt took an hour plus waiting time and meant planning ahead. Now, it takes 12 minutes, Lars Fuhr says. making travel easier The Great Belt Link has made travelling around in Denmark much easier. For example, the number of available train seats have gone up from 11,000 to 40,000 per year. ENTERING NEW Territory WITHIN BRIDGE ENGINEERING The link across the Great Belt is 18 km long and connects the eastern and western parts of Denmark. It consists of two bridges and a tunnel, and with a main span of 1,624 metres, the East Bridge was designed to have the longest suspension span in the world. Before the link's construction, it was argued whether such a large scale infrastructure project was even technically and financially feasible. Not least due to the strong winds. We were entering completely new territory within bridge engineering. Nobody had succeeded in building a bridge with such a great span. A major issue was how to tame the wind inside the bridge's structure, explains Allan Larsen, Chief Engineer at COWI. Before the bridge, when we had the ferries, crossing the Great Belt took an hour, and meant planning ahead. Now, it takes 12 minutes. Lars Fuhr CTO and Technical Director at Sund Blt Holding A S What do a bridge, a flute and a guitar have in common Chief Engineer Allan Larsen gives you the answer. Breaking new ground The tricky aerodynamics were far from the only technical challenge. Lars Hauge, Senior Vice President at COWI, had only just joined the company as a young engineer when the Great Belt Link project kicked off. a huge impact on society In June 1997, the first passenger train rolled through the tunnel under the Great Belt, and the bridge for car traffic opened the following year, in 1998. The Great Belt connection is one of the world's largest bridge and tunnel constructions, and the connection has had a tremendous impact on the millions of Danes who use it. The link has increased growth and mobility. One example is that lorry traffic has more than doubled, ensuring flexible distribution. Companies within the industry have also benefitted greatly from knowledge gains in tunnel and bridge engineering by contributing to the construction. Today, several of them, including COWI, are industry leaders in bridge and tunnel design and construction, says Lars Fuhr. Lorry traffic has more than doubled ensuring flexible distribution. Lars Fuhr Technical Director at Sund Blt Holding A S COWI was responsible for the outline design, tender design and detailed design in close collaboration with the architects DISSING WEITLING. The ferries transported around 8,000 cars across the Belt per day. Now, more than 35,000 cars use the link every day, making it a key element in connecting Denmarks different regions. An analysis, published by the Ministry of Transport and Sund Blt, shows that over the course of 50 years the Great Belt Link will give Danish society a gain of DKK 379 billion, equivalent to an annual gain of DKK 9 billion. The gains come from benefits like less time spent crossing the Great Belt and reduced costs and more flexibility when doing business across the different regions. Take a ride with the Rope Access TEam COWI is responsible for maintenance of the Great Belt Bridge. Most of the inspection work is now handled by drones, whereas repairs are still in the hands of humans. Join the Rope Access Team at the top of the bridge, where they inspect it for cracks, hollows or corrosion in the concrete. Facts about the Great Belt Link The East Bridge was designed to have the longest suspension bridge span in the world, but was eventually surpassed by the Akashi Kaiky Bridge in Japan and the Xihoumen Bridge in China. Today, the East Bridge has the world's third longest suspension bridge span. At 8,024 m long the East Tunnel for trains is Europe's third longest bored tunnel. Environmental considerations affected the choice of alignment and determination of the design. In 1997, a report concluded that the marine environment was at least as good as before construction work began. There have been significant savings in energy consumption by switching from ferries to the fixed link. In terms the total carbon footprint, including the carbon used during construction, the bridge was carbon neutral after seven years of operation compared to the ferries. A breakdown of the total number of driving trips shows that motorists with private errands, including commuting, account for approx. 78 , while just under 1 4 of trips are for business purposes. Today, the ticket price is half the cost of the ferry ticket from 1998 adjusted in line with the consumer price index .

Much effort was made to plan and design for sustainable cycles in energy and water throughout Bay South Garden. Energetics of the Conservatories Comprising two glass biomes, the Conservatories replicate the cool dry climate of the Mediterranean and semi arid sub tropical regions and the cool moist climate of the Tropical Montane region. They house a diverse collection of plants that are not commonly seen in this part of the world, some of which are of high conservation value. The conservatories are a statement in sustainable engineering and apply a suite of cutting edge technologies for energy efficient solutions in cooling.This suite of technologies allows GB to reduce our energy consumption by approximately 30 , compared to buildings using conventional cooling technologies. View the full size Minimising solar heat gain The two conservatories are fitted with glasswith a special coating that allows optimal light in for plants, but reduces a substantial amount of heat. The roof is fitted with a sensor operated retractable sails that provide shade to the plants when it gets too hot. Cooling only the occupied zones The Conservatories apply the strategy of cooling only the lower levels, thus reducing the volume of air to be cooled. This is achieved throughdisplacement cooling ground cooling by chilled water pipes cast within the floor slabs enabling cool air to settle at the lower occupied zone while the warm air rises and is vented out at high levels. Generating energy and harnessing waste heat Carbon neutral electricity is generated on site. At the same time, waste heat is captured in the process to regenerate the liquid desiccant. This energy co generation is achieved with the use of a Combined Heat Power CHP steam turbine, which is fuelled by wood and horticultural waste from across Singapore. In doing so, we reduce dependency on grid electricity generated from fossil fuels. De humidifying the air before cooling To reduce the amount of energy required in the cooling process, the air in Flower Dome is de humidified by liquid desiccant drying agent before it is cooled. This desiccant is recycled using the waste heat from the burning of the biomass. Lake system Dragonfly Kingfisher Lakes The Gardens lake system incorporates key ecological processes and functions as a living system. It acts as a natural filtration system for water from the Gardens catchment and provides aquatic habitats for biodiversity such as fishes and dragonflies. Encompassing two main lakes Dragonfly Lake and Kingfisher Lake, the lake system is designed to be an extension of the Marina Reservoir. Water run off from within the Gardens is captured by the lake system and cleansed by aquatic plants before being discharged into the reservoir. Naturally treated water from the lake system is also used in the irrigation system for the Gardens. The lake system depicts the role and importance of plants in the healthy functioning of our ecosystem. It raises awareness of the value that aquatic plants play in nature, and highlights the significance of clean water in sustaining biodiversity. View the full size Filtering of water run off Filter beds, comprising of aquatic reeds, and wetlands are located where water enters and discharges from the lake system. Water ow is reduced and sediments are ltered out. Reducing nutrient load Islands of aquatic plants and reed beds are incorporated to absorb nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the water. A reduction of nitrogen levels is critical to minimising alga bloom and ensures better water quality. Maintaining an aquatic ecosystem Habitats for sh and dragony are created within the lake system by maintaining a diversity of aquatic plants, good water circulation and aeration. This keeps in check potential problems such as mosquito breeding. Supertrees Environmentally Sustainable Functions of the Supertrees Eleven of the Supertrees are embedded with environmentally sustainable functions. Some have photovoltaic cells on their canopies to harvest solar energy for lighting up the Supertrees, while others are integrated with the Conservatories and serve as air exhaust receptacles. VIILevent Photography Energy Conservation Practice As part of our sustainability effort to conserve energy, we switch off non essential decorative and accent illuminations at night. Lighting at walkways and car parks are also reduced during hours of low visitorship. Creating the perfect home for biodiversity Kingfisher Wetlands Nestled amidst lush greenery and two of Gardens by the Bays prominent water bodies, Kingfisher Wetlands is a thriving ground for flora and fauna alike. This freshwater wetlands was designed to enhance connectivity between the Lotus Pond and Kingfisher Lake, and at the same time segue seamlessly with the rest of the Gardens. Concerted efforts were made to develop Kingfisher Wetlands sensitively, so as to allow ecosystem functions to recover and wildlife to reconnect quickly post development. Planting a carbon sink Over 200 mangrove trees and related plants can be found at Kingfisher Wetlands. These include native and critically endangered mangrove species such as the Firefly Mangrove Sonneratia caseolaris and Upriver Orange Mangrove Bruguiera sexangula . Mangroves are able to remove greenhouse gases from the environment and store up blue carbon to mitigate the effects of global warming. Interestingly, these plants are known to be able to sequester more carbon than rainforests. For this reason, mangroves are globally recognised as some of our best allies in the fight against climate change. Submerged in water, mangrove trees also provide nursing environments and shelters critical to the survival of fish species as well as animals like otters. Providing Opportunities for Wildlife Encounters The Wildlife Lookout at Kingfisher Wetlands creates more opportunities for people to experience and encounter local fauna first hand. Besides spotting some of the birds and animals that frequent the area from the Wildlife Lookout, visitors can also learn more about the biodiversity in Gardens by the Bay from educational signage in the vicinity. Creating a salubrious environment for biodiversity to thrive Among the distinctive elements of Kingfisher Wetlands are a series of water cascades and streamlets. Besides enhancing the areas aesthetics, these water features also promote better aeration in the water, which in turn encourages the growth of microhabitats where biodiversity can flourish.

VOC RECENT EVENTS Home Events A Letter From Our CEO to Napierites One Rainy Day in the American War Dear Napierites,Trust your family and you are keeping safe. As the pandemic sweeps the globe, businesses and their leaders face unprecedented challenges adjusting to the sudden and rapid changes, navigating through new realities, and sustaining their business operations. Whether we are in a crisis or not, we all want leaders who follow their hearts as much as they follow their minds.At Napier, we believe every one of us is a leader in our own right. Whether we lead an entire company, a team of people, a group of friends, our families, or just ourselves. We are all leaders in some form or fashion. Whatever size our circle of influence may be today, if we work to improve as leaders, that circle of influence will grow.I will share a small story. One rainy day during the American Revolutionary War, a soldier rode out of his encampment and noticed a group of his comrades desperately trying to put a log on the top of a wall they were building. Each time they attempted it the beam fell. The Corporal in charge was shouting orders and some encouragement, but the soldiers couldnt not get the beam in position. The soldier stopped and observed them for some time and then asked the Corporal Why dont you join in and help The Corporal looked at him and replied, Dont you realise that I am the Corporal Have you ever seen a Corporal do something like that Without saying a word, the soldier dismounted and helped the infantrymen put the timber in place. As they finished, the soldier wiped the sweat from his face, looked at the corporal who was yelling at them the whole time, and said, If you should need help again, call on Washington, your commander in chief, and I will come.That moment the Corporal realised that the whole time, he was speaking to their commander in chief, George Washington, who later went on to become the US President.Delivering service with pride, leading with confidence, inspiring others is called Leadership. Leadership is the ability to translate vision into reality. Great leadership is always through Respect for each other, Honesty, Integrity and Transparency, Pride in work, and Ownership. This is the core DNA of Napier Healthcare. This is what makes us Napierites.We believe, YOU all are bigger than your defined role, and you are much more than your job title, play your part Transcend your job title, lets lead by example Let each one of your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more Happy reading With regards,Tirupathi Karthik AI enabled and Cloud based Technology in Transforming the Healthcare IT Journey Get in touch with us And well get back to you within 48 hours.

Why UIlicious Our core philosophy Test User Journeys, not HTML Write readable, meaningful maintainable tests.Your future self does not want to read an test and wonder hmm... what does this do We believe that tests should be as good as documentation itself.Because if tests are not clear, how do you if it is testing correctly No more unstable CSS and XPATH locatorsThe common cause of tests breaking is the use of unstable CSS and XPATH locators use to target element. These locators go out of sync when the UI code changes. Maintaining tests only to replace broken locators with another unstable locators is a waste of time. Smart Element TargetingUse stable user facing labels to target elementsUsing CSS and XPATH locators, the specific element to target is decided at the time of writing the test. UIlicious lets you instead target elements using stable user facing labels, and it uses a smart fuzzy search algorithm to identify the specific element to target at time of execution. This makes your tests more stable and more tolerant of changes to the UI. Start testing user journeys, not HTML. How does UIlicious smart targeting work More features Supports all major browsersEnsure consistency on all browsers even on IE11.

Such is the case with the oil and gas industry in the region. The industry has undergone substantial reform and accounting standards have improved in an attempt to stabilise and strengthen the markets following the Asian financial crisis. The resultant deregulation and privatisations have, in turn, created opportunities for foreign and domestic investments.From an upstream viewpoint, energy security and price instability have been, and will increasingly continue to be, the most important energy issues faced by regional economies. They are looking at strategising energy security to counter shortterm interruptions due to contingencies e.g. accidents or acts of war and ensure sustainable energy supply to fuel economic growth.The trend of Asian majors gaining a stronger hold regionally, and globally, is being evidenced as they race to secure supply and replace declining reserves. There is also a move towards consortium investment which offers the possibility of sharing investment risks in an environment of capital constraints. The lack of major oil discoveries in the region, in recent years, has also increased the focus on gas portfolios.On the downstream side, the privatisation of major refineries and deregulation of the industry, and the inadequacy of facilities enabling transportation of oil and gas within the region, and for export to elsewhere in the world, present investment opportunities.Oil Gas Sector Challenges A Regional Perspective Market volatility competing growth targetsEnergy securityReserve enhancement replacement and role of technologyInadequate energy infrastructure stranded reserves Environmental concernsNational participation carried interestDomestic market obligationsDissimilar, and complex, fiscal regimesCross border operations and associated risk, management, cost, contractual and regulatory considerations Meeting Your Needs Despite the great potential the industry holds, a failure to comprehend the intricacies of the social, political and economic diversity of countries in the region can very well translate into failure for companies hoping to profit from producing and supplying energy.

Yet, treatment options are typically limited to surgery or liver transplantation. Patients with recurrent disease or those who present with late stage disease have even fewer treatment options, with dismal long term survival rates. The Hepatitis B Hep B virus is potentially causative for over 50 percent of liver cancer cases worldwide, and as much as 80 percent of cases in Asia. Although vaccination has brought down the incidence rate of Hep B infections, there is still a large unmet medical need to discover effective treatment modalities for current sufferers of Hep B. To address this unmet medical need, Lion TCR has developed an autologous T cell immunotherapy against Hep B associated liver cancer and chronic Hep B. Spun off from A STAR, this clinical stage biotechnology startup has been working on its proprietary engineered T cell receptor TCR immunotherapy solutions since 2015. Recently, they have been recognised as the Most Promising Cell Gene Therapy Startup in Asia category at the Asia Pacific Cell Gene Therapy Excellence Awards ACGTEA 2022. Lion TCR is moving full speed ahead. Last year, the company received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for its Investigational New Drug IND Application as well as Fast Track Designation for its lead product LioCyx M004, which is being developed as a potential first in class therapy for Hep B related liver cancer. The FDA Fast Track Designation is reserved for treatments that have demonstrated the potential to solve unmet medical needs for serious medical conditions. Receiving the FDA Fast Track Designation is a significant milestone for Lion TCR, as it expedites the drug approval process to bring such cutting edge therapies more quickly to patients. A trial for this TCR T cell immunotherapy, approved by Health Sciences Authority HSA , has started recruitment of participants at the Singapore General Hospital SGH . More information about the trial can be found on the United States National Library of Medicinewebsite ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04745403 . To be eligible for participation, the patient must meet the following criteria To be eligible for participation, the patient must meet the following criteria Has a history of chronic hepatitis B Has good and or compensated liver function Is not suitable for or had failed conventional treatments Data gathered from this study will help to Evaluate the safety and efficacy of HBV specific TCR T cell immunotherapy Understand patients immunological changes following HBV specific TCR T cell immunotherapy Those interested in participating in this trial can email clinicaltrials liontcr.com or contact SGH at 65 6326 6713. Lion TCRs Scientific Founder Professor Antonio Bertoletti and CEO Dr Peng Xiaoming share how the company positioned itself for success. Identify blue oceans and be first on the scene In the fiercely competitive biomedical industry, identifying an untapped market and becoming a key solution provider for the market will help companies score a strong competitive advantage. With limited treatment options for HCC, Lion TCR identified a clear need for new therapies. Lion TCRs technology is based on research led by Professor Antonio Bertoletti from A STAR. He initiated the world's first clinical trial using HBV specific TCR T cells to treat virus related cancers. With Prof Bertolettis expertise, alongside research partner Duke NUS Medical School, Lion TCR established itself as the market leader, becoming the first in the world to use HBV specific TCR T cell immunotherapy to treat liver cancer. Technology licensing to shorten time to market Lion TCR acquired the global exclusive license for A STARs engineered T cell technology in 2015. With these key patents and exclusive know how from A STAR, Lion TCR was able to develop first in class therapy for Hep B related liver cancer in a short time, and move to the clinical stage rapidly.With strong support from A STAR and Enterprise Singapore, it subsequently established its R D and production base in Singapore for the manufacturing of clinical products for use in multi national clinical studies. Definitely, technology licensing with A STAR will provide a jumpstart for companies to gain an advantage in a competitive field. But, the company should have a clear idea on how to use the technology, and ensure it has related expertise to develop the technology into a real pipeline to enter clinical stage. Professor Antonio Bertoletti, Scientific Founder and Chairman, Lion TCR Fast track product development with technology licensing. Apply here Tap on R D talent to optimise and commercialise the licensed technology Lion TCR is also building up its intellectual property portfolio and its in house R D capabilities to keep its competitive advantage. This is where R D talent is crucial. The right expertise will help businesses expand their technical capabilities and build a sustainable innovation pipeline. Lion TCR found their R D talent by tapping on A STARs T Up programme. The T Up programme seconds A STAR scientists to companies to help them build up their R D capabilities and support innovation in product development. Through the T Up programme, Dr Sarene Koh, Senior Research Fellow from A STARs SIgN, was seconded to Lion TCR as Director of Technology Manufacturing. She leads Lion TCRs product development and process optimisation, taking their solutions from research lab scale to clinical trial scale. Dr Wai Lu En, Research Scientist from A STARs SIgN, assumed the role of Director of Research Development at Lion TCR during the T Up programme. She built up the companys HBV TCR library into the largest patented HBV TCR library in the world, covering about 80 percent of the global population. This means that Lion TCR could provide treatment solutions for most patients with HBV related HCC. The T Up programme offered Lion TCR access to scientists with valuable knowledge and skills to help build up our technology, especially because we had limited resources. They also helped to link the company closer to A STAR, which allowed us to deepen the discovery and development of the TCR library, thereby bringing the production of HBV TCR T cells from the research lab to clinical studies.

Home Corporate Information Institute of Technology Research Organization Center for Carbon Neutral Engineering Center for Carbon Neutral Engineering Addresses various environmental issues such as energy conservation and renewable energy The Center for Carbon Neutral Engineering seeks to achieve energy conservation and carbon neutrality in buildings and urban areas by realizing net zero energy buildings ZEBs , which aim to reduce building energy consumption to zero, and using renewable energy. It is also engaged in R D related to well being technologies that enrich peoples lives, such as those for a society that coexists harmoniously with nature and medical treatment environments. Energy conservation Based on the task and ambient approach, we are promoting R D related to equipment and control technologies that achieve energy conservation and comfortable environments in office spaces and clean rooms. This approach involves loosely controlling air conditioning and lighting throughout the entire space while allowing localized control according to individual preferences. The office space of our Hokuriku Branch that achieves energy conservation and comfortable environments Energy saving, clean air conditioning system CLEAN EYE Renewable energy power generation Based on the premise that nearby facilities will use CO2 free hydrogen as an energy source, we have developed a new hydrogen storage alloy that is safe and suitable for use in constructing mass storage tanks. With these tanks, we have commercialized Hydro Q BiC, a building attached hydrogen utilization system. This system utilizes surplus renewable energy to produce, store transport, and use CO2 free hydrogen. Following a field test in Koriyama City, Fukushima, we introduced the system into an office building for the first time in Japan. We are actively promoting its social implementation as a technology for the efficient use of renewable energy. Solar panels and Hydro Q BiC Hydrogen Energy Utilization System at a general local wholesale market in Koriyama City Hydro Q BiC in operation at our Hokuriku Branch Nature symbiosis The center develops technology aimed at realizing construction business that takes the environment into consideration, in areas such as biotechnology, greening, ecosystem assessment, water quality control, soil remediation, and environmental simulations. We strive for regeneration and creation of the natural environment through an optimal mix of these technologies.

Every NP student is exposed to at least one Service Learning module where they apply their course skills and knowledge to tackle real life issues in the community. Our goal is to deepen our students learning and inspire them to become a force for good in society. In short we provide our leaders of tomorrow the knowledge and experience to make a better world today For more Service Learning opportunities, students can also take up a civic internship, a Minor in Social Leadership under NPs Personalised Learning Pathway programme, participate in an overseas Youth Expedition Project, or opt for a Capstone Service Learning project NP partners with many organisations across industries, in curating Service Learning opportunities for our students. Resorts World Sentosa is one of them and heres what they have to say about our collaboration. Nurturing the next generation of talent who can help shore up our nations sustainability drive is imperative. Through the Sustainability RWS programme in collaboration with NP, we aim to firstly, boost awareness and practical understanding of sustainable tourism amongst students today, who can in turn drive positive impact tomorrow and secondly, play our part in driving sustainability education and advocacy amongst all our stakeholders. This aligns to our broader ambition of creating positive environmental and socio economic impact for the communities in which we operate. Ms Loh Su Kim Vice President, Sustainability, RWS Service Learning Stories Get a glimpse into Service Learning in NP Civic Internships Promote social good at the workplace Social Leadership Pathway Pursue a minor that makes a difference Overseas Service Learning Impact communities around the world Service Learning Partners Forge stronger social bonds Dialogue in the Dark Learn to See Hear from our students partners As part of my civic internship, I was a marketing intern with Soap Cycling Singapore, an organisation that focuses on recycling soap and educating the community on sanitation, hygiene and soap wastage. Im grateful that I could apply the skills and knowledge learnt from my Business Studies diploma for a good cause and Ive learnt not to take something as simple as soap for granted Hu Yixuan Elise Diploma in Business Studies, Class of 2022 Civic Internship Programme with Soap Cycling Singapore During my civic internship, I found myself using my engineering knowledge and skills to help people. It was so rewarding to see the faces of the elderly light up in understanding when I explained engineering concepts to them in a simple way or when I helped to get their faulty electrical devices working again. I also gained other skills such as in programme content development and implementation as well as networking. Siti Jasmeen Bte Mohamad Ali Diploma in Engineering Science, Class of 2023 Civic Internship Programme with Sustainable Living Lab NP's Civic Internship has opened up our organisation to great interns who want to make a difference in the community, and in turn has given NP students great insight into a career in the social sector. In fact, one of the NP interns has joined us full time We hope this programme can be rolled out to other institutes of higher learning as well to promote empathy and selflessness amongst the youths who are the future of our country. Johann Annuar Executive Director, Engineering Good Having the NP civic interns work on their Civic Challenge projects with HIM saved me much time and effort. And they did a great job I have partners and other contacts keen to hire NP students as interns or to have them work on similar projects, after seeing what was done for HIM. Adeline Wong Founder, Human Animal Bond In Ministry HIM Thanks to my Service Learning module, I have learnt how to better understand a target audience and its needs. I got to see that it is important to do this before we go into ideation. Otherwise, we may design solutions that may not be relevant or useful to our target group. Hu Xiang Shi Diploma in Aerospace Engineering, Class of 2022 Unlike a vacation, YEP allows you to really get on the ground and understand the lives of the locals. YEP made me realize that we take things for granted in Singapore and that we have a lot of opportunities, unlike the youths we met who had to drop out of school, despite having aptitude. I also gained a group of tight knit friends Tang Jia Wen Diploma in Mass Communication, Class of 2021 Youth Expedition Project YEP in Vietnam, 2019 The NP students were very open to feedback and adjusting their plans. Through verbal and visual cues, they actively engaged our clients who really enjoyed the games and dance sessions that were organised. It has been a good experience and we would love to continue this partnership with NP Tan Song Jie Engagement Executive, MINDSIndustry Partner The Social Leadership Personalised Learning Pathway PLP opened my eyes to communities I had not known much about before. For example, I wasnt aware of homelessness in Singapore I have learnt that homeless people, like most humans, seek respect and dignity. I also got exposure to migrant workers. After this PLP experience, I am certain that service will remain an integral part of my life. Gouri Binu Diploma in Biomedical Sciences, Year 3Pursuing a Minor in Social Leadership For PLP, I volunteered with the elderly, befriending them and conducting online activities to engage them. It made me realise that I had stereotyped the elderly as grumpy people. They had such interesting stories to share and enthusiastically participated in our activities Ernst Wong Diploma in Accountancy, Year 3 ContactOffice of Service Learning Ngee Ann PolytechnicBlk 5, 01 01535 Clementi RoadSingapore 599489np osl np.edu.sgNPservicelearning NPServiceLearning Office of Service Learning Contact Us535 Clementi Road Singapore 5994896466 6555asknp np.edu.sgQuick LinksStudent PortalNPalConnect MailFull Time CoursesPart Time CoursesLibraryIndustry Connect with us Sign up This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

Weve put together a supply chain terminology list of some of the most commonly used logistics and shipping terminology, acronyms, word and phrases and created a second list of the most common acronyms and terms related to DSV. General terms 3PL Third party logistics. 3PL in logistics and supply chain management is an organisation's use of third parties to whom they outsource elements of its distribution, warehousing etc. DSV is primarily considered a third party logistics provider. 4PL Fourth party logistics, also referred to as lead logistics. 4PL providers assume many of the same roles as 3PL providers but have a much broader role within the supply chain.

Haulier Haulier is used primarily in the UK, but elsewhere 'trucking company' is used more often.

Deliveroo makes those moments far more memorable by delivering meals from places that dont normally do that. The quick, clean interface makes it super easy to find nearby burgers, sushiwhatevers calling your nameand then place an order. We particularly love how the real time updates on the drivers progress tell us exactly when you'll get to satisfy that appetite. Sammybabbbyyyy , 22 11 2021 Cant find my house ever so foods mostly cold. The street I live in has a very bad signpost, we have told the council to change it and they put the same sign up. It directs traffic to the bottom of the three section culdesac for numbers 1 20 then directs the traffic to the top for numbers 33 60 but does not mention numbers 21 32 so drivers go down to the bottom of the hill drive up passing our house blindly following sat nav instead of looking at street numbers, they then drive up to the third section of our street and then leave without looking at a single door just relying on computers or phones or sat Nats. The council refuses to fix the problem and this happens every day even with postmen. Please please people stop relying on mobile devices look out your car window or up from your phone sat nav instead. So many times I ring an hour later or the delivery guy rings me when hes back in Plymouth 4 miles away then they listen to me come back and leave cold food and very often milkshakes and desserts are spilled or melted or separated curdled yet they never refund or give a fresh meal and if you say anything the drivers complain about me not about their lack of knowledge about the area. Such a shame because possibly the food would be ok without inept drivers. Also Taco Bell in Plymouth sends out rotten salads. Three times we received mouldy tomatoes and rotting brown lettuce. Thank you very much leave the eu voters you guys wrecked England. Never be without it , 05 05 2020 Fantastic... with reservations Just used Deliveroo for the first time to deliver an order from our local co op. Arrived at the speed of light Well done Deliveroo and the Co op By way of a postscript although we were charged for our original order there were a few items which were substituted for items of lesser value which in themselves were ok, even if not what we ordered and one item which was substituted by something we did not want, and for considerably less value. Having raised this with Deliveroo we received a reasonably quick response, apologising and saying our Deliveroo account had been credited with a sum in excess of the amount overcharged us which we could use against any Deliveroo order in the next three months. BUT I dont want a time limited credit against a future Deliveroo order I want my money back which is what youd get with any other supermarket . So this is the big flaw with using Deliveroo for grocery deliveries where especially these days theres every chance there will be substitutions you have no direct relationship with the supplier as all the money goes through Deliveroo, as do any complaints. I still think the service is good in terms of speed and convenience but not being able to get my money back is a big sticking point for me and as I do not want to run the risk of ordering through them again and being overcharged if the order is not what we want, sadly, I wont be using them again.

Consumers are looking for less sugars, fewer calories, and more nutrition With Roquette solutions, meet the nutrition challenges facing today. US food customers can access online a large selection of plant based food ingredients Learn more. Soft drinks are increasingly marketed to help make a healthy lifestyle attractive. Consumers are increasingly demanding beverages that incorporate less sugars and fewer calories and that also offer more nutrition. There is a vast amount of scientific evidence to support the consumption of low calorie, sweetened drinks as an aid to weight management 1 , including the maintenance of weight loss 2 . Consumers also have a preference for functional and fortified products incorporating minerals, vitamins and fiber. When a beverage contains ingredients that are specifically for health purposes, it is important to ensure that the taste and texture are not adversely affected. The majority of consumers will not buy soft drinks if their taste fails their expectations. This poses a major challenge to developers the healthy ingredients must not introduce even the slightest bitterness, aftertaste, etc. And this is not all as the demand forgood tasting,nutritiousandhealthybeverages grows so does the pressure for solutions that are alsocost effective. Flavor change, emulsion stability, preservation, nutrition, health and cost are all part of the complex, demanding equation. At the same time, these prerequisites also offer opportunities to develop new products that offer health as an attractive part of the mix. Roquette food experts are ready to sharebreakthrough solutionsand tested concepts and recipes to help beverage developers to meet the nutrition challenges they face today not least by creating beverages that deliver a great taste experience. 1 De la Hunty et al. 2006. A review of the effectiveness of aspartame in helping with weight control. British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin 31, 115 128 2 S Phelen et al., Use of artificial sweeteners and fat modified foods in weight loss maintainers and always normal weight individuals, International Journal of Obesity, online edition, August 2009 Sugar free fibre every day Beverages like sodas, sugary juices and sweet energy drinks have become a major source of calories and are therefore the target of urgent efforts to improve their profile. Beverages with health benefits are set to continue to boom, with fibre supplementation leading the way. The incorporation of fibre can only be a good thing for the consumer, while for the manufacturers it is a key to positive label claims. It is also the key to making products acceptable to core customers in respect of taste, texture and sensory quality. Meeting so many objectives at once has understandably made fibre the focus of our attention. We offer NUTRIOSE for beverages sugar free soluble fibers. NUTRIOSE is an all round fibre. It makes it possible to reach easily attainable nutritional goals because it is the only sugar free fibre with proven health benefits. It is soluble and extracted from wheat or maize and therefore a traditional food ingredient that, thanks to Roquette policy, also happens to be guaranteed non GMO. It has very slight viscosity as a bulking agent in thinner beverages in soft drinks this can mimic the mouthfeel associated with sucrose, yet without having an undesirable health impact. This makes it a great partner for high intensity sweeteners. Thanks to its high molecular weight, NUTRIOSE can match the mouthfeel of beverages using sucrose but with a significantly lower dosage requirement. It also dissolves just like sugar, and does not require specific or sophisticated production technologies. Since is virtually wholly neutral in both colour and taste it cannot be detected by either eye or taste buds when dissolved in a beverage. Beverages provide a great opportunity to help people increase their fibre consumption because drinking beverages forms a very large and conveniently obtainable part of consumer nutrient consumption habits. The unique properties of NUTRIOSE allow the soluble fibre to be included in any type of beverage, even in large quantities, thus providing a truly positive effect on health, yet with no negative impacts on consumer acceptability. NUTRIOSE also exhibits a high tolerance factor that has been clinically evaluated at 45g day, with no associated digestive discomfort. And due to its low glycaemic and insulin emic index 25 and 13 respectively NUTRIOSE also offers a long lasting energy effect for sport and energy drink formulations. NUTRIOSE has clinically proven benefits on digestive health and blood glucose management, allowing producers to label lower glycaemic response if NUTRIOSE is used to replace sugars in drinks.

PHOTOS RONALD LOH, JETSTAR, MSF, HDB More and more agencies here are employing chatbots, including a firm whose bots made sales on their ownRonald LohReporterDec 20, 2016 06 00 am Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp E mail this article 0 Engagements It started as a way to automate replies to their customers. But employing chatbots a program that uses artificial intelligence AI to carry on a conversation in July this year turned out to be a gold mine for Mr Kester Poh and his team. Mr Poh is the co founder of AskVoila, a digital personal shopper service that helps customers pick, review and buy items such as electronics, clothes and even groceries online via Facebook Messenger. At first, we hoped the chatbots would just help us reply to customers, but it turned out that they actually sealed some deals on their own. From there, we started looking out how to further develop our chatbot technology, before we realised we could make it into a business in itself, he said. Today, Mr Poh, 32, and his business partners Mr Matthew Low, 32, and Mr Yong Siong Wee, 33 run AiChat, a firm specialising in developing chatbots for businesses. Singapore This is no smiley faced robot, but it should make you smile Jul 27, 2022 Related Stories SafeTravel website crashes due to surge in travel pass applications 5.9 million customers hit by RedDoorz data breach All government agencies to accept digital ICs from next week Interacting with a chatbot is similar to chatting with a human being. Users type a question into a chat window and the bot will answer. Their clients include a big electronics brand and several food and beverage outlets, though they declined to reveal details of their clients as their products have not been officially launched. DEMAND While there are fewer than 10 firms specialising in creating chatbots here, the demand is surely growing. The global market for chatbots was estimated at US 627.7 million S 910 million last year, according to a report released in August by Transparency Market Research. By 2024, the chatbot market is expected to be worth US 7.9 billion. The Government has also been building on this technology. Its Conversations As A Platform project, announced in July, was set up to better help users navigate government e services in a conversation style. One example is the Government's Ask Jamie bot, which was jointly developed by the now defunct Infocomm Development Authority and the Ministry of Finance, and runs on a natural language processing engine to understand the questions asked by the public before responding. It has been deployed on the websites of 17 government agencies, including the Government Technology Agency GovTech , the Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Ministry of Education. The Housing Board website and mobile app also has its own chatbot Ask Judy that can answer questions on new flat applications and season parking. A GovTech spokesman told The New Paper that the Ask Jamie bot is undergoing a trial in collaboration with Mircosoft on popular messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Telegram to answer questions from members of the public. Beyond the current pilot, there are plans to extend the chatbot toexploretransactional and personalised enquiries,bringing innovation and ease of use to the next level, said the spokesman. Big firms such as DBS South east Asia's largest bank, and Jetstar, which launched its Ask Jess virtual assistant in November 2013, have already jumped on the chatbot bandwagon. Mr Poh said chatbots have helped his digital shopper business. At their peak, in August, the bots closed 6 per cent to 7 per cent of deals on their own. If we translate to manpower, it means we could cut our frontline manpower that deals with customers by 60 per cent to 70 per cent and have them redeployed to other aspects of our business, he said. Mr Poh said he expects the market to scale tremendously in the next five years. Co founder of Gotobot.ai, Mr Sze Tho ChangSheng, agreed. Similar to AiChat, Mr Sze Tho and his co founders Ms Sujata Liao, 32, and Mr Wayne Tng, 26 started Gotobot.ai after realising how chatbots helped their online restaurant booking firm Chatobook. As time and technology progresses, we could see chatbots automating even more tasks, such as making purchases, converting currency, booking appointments and setting alerts. They can be applied everywhere and are not difficult to be programmed. When the AI gets smarter and is able to process more information such as image, facial or voice recognition, it can only get better, he said. Examples of chatbotsRonald LohReporter ASK JAMIE Ask Jamie is found on government websites, such as that of the Ministry of Education MOE and the Singapore Land Authority SLA , and is optimised for mobile devices. While the answers are generally relevant to the website you are at, Jamie can provide useful answers pertaining to other government agencies. ASK JUDY Judy answers questions on new flat applications and season parking. In addition to the use of natural language processing, Ask Judy has a built in contextual memory feature that can provide relevant answers from previous conversations. ASK JESS Jess is a virtual assistant that answers questions related to Jetstar's fares and services. It is powered by technology from Nuance Communications, known for its speech recognition software.

Business Economy 321 Views newsfeedadmin August 19, 2022 Business Economy Southeast Asias E Commerce is expanding rapidly than ever before. The middle class, their spending ability, as well as the use of the internet is growing throughout the region. All of these indicate that the regions e commerce market is expanding. E commerce in Southeast Asia is expected to reach US 88 billion by 2025, according to a study undertaken by Google and Temasek, with Singapore at its core. Lets understand what makes e commerce in Singapore attractive to the world market. Southeast Asias E Commerce Market Potential Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, and Singapore are the ten countries that make up Southeast Asia. The ten members of the region have a combined population of almost 625 million people. Around 70 of the population in Southeast Asia is under the age of 40, and 190 million individuals in this region are now classified as middle class, with daily disposable earnings ranging from US 16 to US 100. Hence, this combination of factors such as youth and newly acquired purchasing power, makes the region especially appealing as a potential e commerce market. Southeast Asia is the worlds fastest expanding internet market, thanks to increased access to mobile networks, but consumers arent the only ones who benefit from e commerce. The increased demand for e commerce in the region brings in new business opportunities as well as new obstacles. However, Singapore has already positioned itself as the best country to face these challenges head on. A Well Positioned E Commerce Hub According to the Google and Temasek report, to make Southeast Asia a powerful digital economy by 2025, the region requires capital. Singapore is the greatest place to find said capital. It is the most active venture capital market in SEA, and in the last few years, Singapore has seen a surge in investments in e commerce startups. Lazada, a Singapore based e commerce platform, received a handsome investment from Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba in 2016. Alibaba tapped into Lazadas already established operations in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines to expand into Southeast Asia. SEA Ltd. previously Garena received funding at the start of 2017 to expand its Indonesian e commerce platform Shoppee. Aside from online platforms, logistic firms have also benefited from additional funding. Alibaba invested in Singpost, a postal delivery service, a year after Alibaba paid for a 34 percent share in SingPosts e commerce logistics arm, Quantum Solutions International. Photo by Jisun Han SEAs Leading Business Centre With a population of 5.6 million residents, Singapore accounts for less than 1 of Southeast Asias total population. However, it has attracted 27 of all e commerce firms in the region, with the most startups valued at over 10 million, 100 million, and 1 billion. Singapores reputation for ease of doing business best explains the disproportionate trend. The median number of days it takes to incorporate a business in Southeast Asia is 24.5 days, according to World Bank figures. In Singapore, on the other hand, a new business can be formed in as little as 15 minutes. Singapore also draws entrepreneurs because of its low company tax rate of 17 , which is lower than the typical corporate tax rate of 20 in Southeast Asia. Finally, Singapores government is known around the world for its efficiency and minimal levels of corruption. Singapores excellent legal system enables for the fastest contract dispute resolution periods in Asia. Singapores Parliament is working to minimise the governments burden on businesses, and policies that encourage free trade are presently being established. Cross border trade will almost certainly continue to be a driving force behind Southeast Asias e commerce expansion. The ASEAN Economic Community AEC was established to enhance trade in Southeast Asia by the ten countries that make up the region. Because of its strategic location, Singapore has become a major logistical centre for goods travelling throughout Southeast Asia. Singapores port handles millions of containers each year, while Changi Airport handles more air cargo than any other Southeast Asian airport. The expansion of Southeast Asias online economy has paved the way for Singapore to become the regions emerging e commerce hub. More residents of the region will be able to buy and sell things online. To keep up with the fast growing demand, new business models, internet platforms, and logistical businesses will be required, and these new firms will require funding in order to grow and survive. They will also require easy cross border commerce access and world class logistics. Singapore is well prepared to supply all of these to the world market under one roof.

Mr Thiru had created a very detailed master list which explained every CCTVs position and also every different type of fire extinguishers location in the building. He had also given me some suggestions on how to improve some of our security features in IGCI.

Our work was unique, combining two actual office move phases between 3 separate Singapore address locations, using both specific HDS corporate security standard brand technology and APRO Technology locally recommended additions all managed between two continents and corresponding time zones within a 90 day period. However, while this review of our recent efforts may seem impressive, this comment does not express the many specific details that were managed so well and with such a sense of ownership and service by Beng Chuan and the APRO Technologys team.

Water Water Improved Quality for a Critical Resource Water is an important resource both for our businesses and for the communities where we live and work. The Water Research team works to develop technologies and strategies to ensure water resource sustainability. For example, our microbiology lab uses state of the art technology to study microorganisms and enhance their performance in wastewater treatment plants, improving the quality of water discharged from facilities. SeRT SeRT Efficiently and Effectively Limiting Byproducts Phillips 66 has developed sorbent based technology as a very cost effective solution for refineries to meet regulatory limits on the discharge of selenium, a byproduct of the refining process. Our SeRT technology offers a simple, low cost process that looks and runs like many other refinery processes and is not workforce intensive. Phillips 66 offers consulting services in selenium separation and licensing of technology for selenium removal. SERT TECHNOLOGY Operating Excellence Safety and Reliability Overall We support and improve our existing business by creating and applying advanced analytical capabilities, conducting catalyst characterizations and process modeling. Assessments Improve Stability Metallurgical Analysis Close Metallurgical Analysis The Metallurgical Analysis team supports operating excellence by evaluating the integrity of process equipment and pipelines used in our Refining and Midstream operations. Using advanced instrumentation and decades of experience, the team determines corrosion and material degradation mechanisms in process units and evaluates complex welding issues. These analyses ensure asset integrity, keeping hydrocarbons safely inside pipelines and process equipment where they belong. Preparation Informs Reaction Environmental Forensics Close Environmental Forensics Phillips66 is committed to operating safely, sustainably and in an environmentally friendly manner. In the likely event that hydrocarbons are detected in the environment, we are committed to responding as quickly, accurately and comprehensively as possible its part of our commitment to care for the environment. Determining the composition, age and potential source of hydrocarbon materials detected helps us respond rapidly and appropriately to any potential situation. Anticipating Problems Before They Occur Analytical Forensics Close Analytical Forensics Refineries are complex facilities that operate continuously. These continuous operations are challenging when processing a variety of crude oils and other feedstocks. The Analytical Forensics team leverages a variety of analytical techniques to provide chemical insights related to feedstocks, intermediates and products to address operational problems. When problems occur, the team provides actionable recommendations to ensure a quick return to safe operations and prevent the problem from recurring. Optimizing and Controlling Operations Refining Process Support Close Refining Process Support Determining catalyst performance can be a challenging problem but is needed to efficiently produce clean transportation fuels. Using internally developed testing techniques, our researchers identify catalysts that optimize the performance of refinery units, such as the fluid catalytic cracker, hydrocracker, hydrotreater or naphtha reformer. Their work ensures that refineries select catalysts that are best suited for optimal operations. Empowering the Engineers Process Modeling Close Process Modeling Phillips66 puts the knowledge of process experts into the hands of decision makers at its facilities by deploying engineering models and user friendly conceptual tools. These models and tools are used to plan, optimize and control complex refinery operations. They give operations staff instant feedback and equip them to run scenarios and optimize refinery processes. Reducing Wear in Critical Equipment Lubricants Close Lubricants The Lubricants R D team conducts fundamental research, market driven product development and product stewardship to meet the latest performance demands in transportation and industrial lubricants. The team completes more than 500 lab and pilot blends and 20,000 performance tests per year in a state of the art, internationally accredited facility.

She wouldnt dwell on anything that doesnt provide tangible value to her clients, and it is this approach to her job that has seen her perform consistently beyond expectations in her 9 years with People Profilers. As a manager, Eve oversees two teams currently, gladly sharing and implementing her lean methodology with newer recruiters and staff.Eve covers clients in real estate, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and educational industries, and works with several multinational fortune 500 companies. Her recruitment scope is currently focused primarily on corporate senior management positions. As would be expected for such placements, the key issue that many of her clients face is finding, and subsequently attracting, the top names and talent in the field. Eve understands that for senior management positions, it is equally important that the candidate is keen on the client, as much so as it is vice versa. To this end, Eve and her team go through their huge database to derive an assessment of client interests against that of the potential candidates. This approach is rooted in practicality as much as it is in experience, and it has served her well in achieving high rates of successful placements even in the face of the most challenging requirements.Eve purports that client satisfaction is difficult, if not impossible, to attain unless one knows precisely what the client wants. While this may seem intuitive, it requires conscientious diligence on the recruiters part to plumb the depths of the clients business and work culture. By doing this, Eve acts as not only a recruiter, but like an extended arm of the clients own HR team.Eves advice to others in the field would be to have a good understanding of the market trends and the many facets of the prospective employers profile. Regardless of ones position, whether it be a recruiter, candidates, or employer, knowledge is power, says Eve. next team member Home About Us Our Story Our Consultants Community Involvement Join Our Team Our Story Our Consultants Community Involvement Join Our Team Linkedin Facebook Instagram Our Services Contract and Temporary Staffing Employment and Work Pass Application General Recruitment Headhunting and Executive Search IT Manpower Outsourcing Outplacement and Career Transition Payroll Outsourcing Employer of Record EOR Payroll Parking Workforce Skills Qualifications Courses Contract and Temporary Staffing Employment and Work Pass Application General Recruitment Headhunting and Executive Search IT Manpower Outsourcing Outplacement and Career Transition Payroll Outsourcing Employer of Record EOR Payroll Parking Workforce Skills Qualifications Courses Clients Submit a Vacancy Our Specialisations Our Expertise Testimonials Submit a Vacancy Our Specialisations Our Expertise Testimonials Candidates Job Opportunities Upload Resume Why Us Job Opportunities Upload Resume Why Us Articles Contact People Profilers is an adopter of People Profilers is awarded with 2023 .

Due to the aggressive environment within which the typical storage tank resides the harsh contents and the extreme weather conditions they are often exposed too, means the re coating of these vessels is a necessary demand. The vast size of the tanks, the difficulty in logistics and the tight schedules are often challenging requirements for a contractor to meet. Moisture and temperature is a constant threat to coating success during tank projects. Whether its corrosion, condensation, paint that will not dry or blushing due to excess moisture or temperature, the problems are real and costly. The loss of productivity, materials and man hours due to moisture problems or unexpected weather conditions can directly affect the cost of any project. The corrosion rate during an outage can be accelerated by the presence of acids and dissolved salts as well as the presence of hygroscopic salts which absorb moisture from the surrounding air. The oxidation of steel requires the presence of moisture and oxygen. Using our dry air method, one of these factors is eliminated preventing corrosion.

Global Citizens everywhere should invest in technologies that lower their carbon footprint and emissions using BAT Best Available Technology . We owe it to the communities we serve and their future generations, said Geoff Lawrence, Twenty20 Energy CEO. Were acting with urgency and purpose to implement cleaner energy solutions for today and beyond. Not only did Twenty20 Energy invest in Solar Turbines SoLoNOx combustion reduction technology, reducing the plants NOx emissions by over 85 , they are able to reduce the countrys carbon footprint by 36 metric tons per day when all three units run at full load. In this condition, a saving of up to 13,500 metric tons of CO2 can be recognized annually the equivalent of taking over 3,000 cars off the road each year. The Dirio Central Province Power Station, constructed and operated by Twenty20 Energy, entered commercial operation in November 2021 and can deliver 45 MW of cleaner, more reliable and cost effective energy to the PNG grid. Caution Bay Substation Project Twenty20 Energy has played an integral role in efforts to expand power infrastructure in Papua New Guinea, another step in transitioning the country to cleaner, more reliable power supplies. Twenty20 Energy designed and constructed the Dirio power plant 66kV substation, which consists of two 66 11kV, 60 MVA fully redundant generator step up transformers with automatic voltage control and off take structures. The substation incorporates state of the art Hitachi Power Grids compact Gas Insulated Switchgear, consisting of a single skid containing a split bus arrangement with two incomers and two transformer feeders, together with bushing current transformers and potential transformers. Additionally, within the substation, Twenty20 Energy integrated the latest in Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories protection relays for incoming circuit and transformer protection, as well as remote terminal communications with the power utility. The project demonstrates Twenty20 Energys ability to deliver a wide range of power infrastructure solutions, including vital transmission and distribution infrastructure to connect power generating assets. Reliable power is a crucial pillar in supporting the ongoing development efforts in the region and the Dirio 66kv Substation is a step in the right direction. IN DEVELOPMENT Power Island FSRP Project PAWA PNG Floating Power Island Twenty20 Energy is working with PAWA PNG on a floating power island project that will deliver an integrated liquid natural gas LNG logistics and power generation solution to meet Papua New Guineas PNG energy and electrification objectives now and for the future. The project will deliver cleaner, more reliable electricity that most efficiently and cost effectively harnesses PNGs domestic LNG supply for powering the country. Twenty20 Energys Power Island FSRP Project proposal has been approved by the PNG Cabinet for rollout across the country in 12 strategic locations, providing 283MW of power generation capacity where it is needed most to help boost access to reliable power supply and to improve overall electrification. The PAWA PNG Power Island Project is a product of Twenty20 Energys proprietary Power Island FSRP technology, which consists of fuel barges, power barges and floating piers. Twenty20s floating power island technology allows for distributed generation, which delivers a cost effective and environmentally sensitive power generation solution for remote communities leveraging LNG. The project will assist PNG to achieve national energy security and independence while enhancing the lives of the people of PNG through the many social and economic benefits which are enabled by the provision of reliable, cost effective electricity supply. This initial deployment will be a proof of concept for the technology, both advancing PNGs energy objectives and demonstrating global applicability of the Power Island FSRP for remote coastal locations. IN DEVELOPMENT Hela Project 66 MW Gas Fired Power Plant in Papua New Guineas Hela Region Twenty20 Energy will design, build, operate and maintain a 66MW, gas fired power plant in Papua New Guineas Hela province on behalf of Dirio Gas Power Company Ltd. Twenty20 Energy will provide operation and maintenance services for 20 years. Twenty20 Energy intends to invest 20 percent of the required funds alongside Dirio, consistent with the companys strategy to take ownership positions in energy assets that deliver long term returns for investors while also partnering with local communities to deliver tangible improvements in their quality of life. The power station will be comprised of 4 Solar Turbines Titan 130 Modular Power Plant Sets in Open Cycle configuration, each with a rated capacity of 16.5MW reaching the required 66MW in total.
